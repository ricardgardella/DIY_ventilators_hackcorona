# DIY_ventilators_hackcorona

This repository contains all the code for the Hack Corona hackaton, with the objective of helping reducing the impact of the COVID-19 in society.

The objective  was to develop a chatbox to help engineers that want to build a DIY ventilator by giving instructions, list components, and components availability information. Ventilators are a key piece of emergency medical equipment which is needed in great quantities in this crisis.
